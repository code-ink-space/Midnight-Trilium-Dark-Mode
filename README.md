# Midnight-Trilium-Dark-Mode
A beautiful, material design inspired dark mode theme for Trilium. 

Supported Trilium version: 0.50.2.

Unsupported: Everything else. However, Midnight was initially developed against 0.49.5, versions greater then that will probably work but only latest supported. Early versions than 0.49.5 not tested.

## Features

  * Comfortable Contrast
  * Maximum Readability
* Dark Mode Friendly Font
* Consistent Design
* Custom Code View Styling
  * Dark Mode Native
  * Ligature Font

## Prerequisites
Technically none, Midnight will try and fetch the fonts it uses from the web. For offline use, or if any problems encountered, please manually install the following fonts:
* [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) - A beautiful font designed specifically for screen use and works well in dark mode compared to default Trilium fonts.
* [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) - The best programming font, great dark mode look and programming ligatures. 

## Installation
* Create a new note in Trilium, store it anywhere you would like.
* Change note type to CSS.
* Paste in the raw contents of [midnight.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwilliams5/Midnight-Trilium-Dark-Mode/main/midnight.css).
* Add an owned attribute of without the quotes "#appTheme=Midnight" to the note.
* Click the Trilium icon in the top left, select options, and under theme select Midnight.
